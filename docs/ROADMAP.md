## **Definition of Done**

For each user story to be considered complete, it must meet the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
2. **Code Quality**: Code reviewed, follows project conventions, and is properly documented
3. **Testing**: Unit tests written with minimum 80% coverage for new components
4. **UI/UX**: Responsive design, accessibility considerations, consistent styling
5. **Performance**: No significant performance regressions, optimized for real-time use
6. **Documentation**: Component documentation and usage examples provided

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Local LLM Performance**: Start with lighter models, implement model swapping capabilities
- **WebRTC Compatibility**: Provide fallback sharing options, browser compatibility matrix
- **File System Access**: Implement progressive enhancement, graceful degradation for limited environments

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Sprint Buffer**: Each sprint includes 20% buffer time for unexpected challenges
- **MVP Prioritization**: P0 features prioritized, P1/P2 features can be moved to future releases
- **Parallel Development**: Some features can be developed in parallel to optimize timeline
